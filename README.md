# Next.js 15 getServerSideProps Async/Await Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's handling of errors within `getServerSideProps` when using `async/await`.  When an asynchronous operation fails, the error isn't always properly caught and reported, resulting in a blank page or a generic 500 error.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the application. You should see a blank page or a generic internal server error.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly handling potential errors using a `try...catch` block within the `getServerSideProps` function. This ensures that any errors are properly caught and can be logged or reported to the user in a more helpful way.

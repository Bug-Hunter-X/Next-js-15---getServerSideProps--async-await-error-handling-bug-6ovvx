In Next.js 15, an uncommon bug can occur when using the `async/await` syntax within a custom `getServerSideProps` function. If the `await` call fails and throws an error, Next.js might not properly handle it, leading to unexpected behavior such as a blank page or an internal server error without a clear error message.  This is particularly insidious as it might not manifest in development mode.
